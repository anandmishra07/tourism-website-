        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <p>
          250 grams Sanai (also known as drumstick leaves)<br>
          2 tablespoons cooking oil<br>
          1 teaspoon mustard seeds<br>
          1 teaspoon cumin seeds<br>
          1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds<br>
          1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped<br>
          2-3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
          1-inch piece of ginger, grated<br>
          2-3 green chilies, slit<br>
          1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder<br>
          1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)<br>
          11 teaspoon coriander powder<br>
          Salt to taste<br>

          Fresh coriander leaves for garnish<br>

        <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>
        <p>
          1. Start by cleaning the Sanai (drumstick leaves). Pluck the leaves from the stems and wash them thoroughly. 
          Drain and set aside.<br><br>
          2. Heat oil in a pan or kadai over medium heat. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and fenugreek seeds. Let them 
          splutter and release their aroma.<br><br>
          3. Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent and slightly brown.<br><br>
          4. Stir in the minced garlic, grated ginger, and slit green chilies. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the 
          raw smell disappears.<br><br>
          5. Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well and sauté for another 2 minutes 
          to allow the spices to cook.<br><br>
          6. Now, add the cleaned Sanai (drumstick leaves) to the pan. Stir and cook for about 5 minutes until the leaves 
          start to wilt.<br><br>
          7. Pour in 1 cup of water. Cover the pan and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes on low heat. This will allow the 
          Sanai to cook and become tender.<br><br>
          8. Check the seasoning and adjust salt and spice levels if needed.<br><br>
          9. Once the Sanai is cooked and the sabzi has a semi-dry consistency, remove it from heat.<br><br>
          10. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.<br><br>
