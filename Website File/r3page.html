          ghee. Its intricate shapes and rich, caramelized flavors make it a delightful treat, often enjoyed during

        <p>
          1 cup whole wheat flour (atta)<br>
          1/2 cup jaggery (gur), finely grated<br>
          2-3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)<br>
          1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder (elaichi)<br>

        <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>
        <p>
          1. In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and finely grated jaggery.<br><br>
          2. Add ghee and cardamom powder to the mixture.<br><br>
          3. Mix all the ingredients together until they resemble breadcrumbs.<br><br>
          4. Gradually add a little water at a time and knead the mixture into a stiff dough. The dough should be firm enough to hold its shape.<br><br>
          5. Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat.<br><br>
          6. While the oil is heating, shape the dough into small, flat discs. You can use your hands or a cookie cutter for this.<br><br>
          7. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide the shaped Thekuas into the oil.<br><br>
          8. Fry them on medium heat until they turn golden brown and crisp on both sides. This should take about 5-6 minutes.<br><br>
          9. Remove the fried Thekuas using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.<br><br>
          10. Allow them to cool completely before storing in an airtight container.<br><br>
