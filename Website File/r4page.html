        <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>
        <p>
          1. Wash the Chana Dal (Split Bengal Gram) thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes.<br><br>
          2. After soaking, drain the water from the Chana Dal.<br><br>
          3. In a pressure cooker, add the soaked and drained Chana Dal, diced Pumpkin, Raw Banana, and Sweet Potato.<br><br>
          4. Add Turmeric Powder and a pinch of Salt to the ingredients in the pressure cooker.<br><br>
          5. Pressure cook these ingredients until you hear 3-4 whistles. Ensure that the Chana Dal and vegetables are cooked well and become soft.<br><br>
          6. In a separate pan, heat Mustard Oil until it starts to smoke. Then, reduce the heat to medium.<br><br>
          7. Add Panch Phoron, Dry Red Chilies, and Bay Leaf to the hot oil. Allow them to splutter and release their aroma.<br><br>
          8. Add Grated Ginger and Asafoetida (Hing) to the pan. Saut√© for a minute until the ginger becomes aromatic.<br><br>
          9. Pour the cooked Chana Dal and vegetable mixture into the pan with the tempering. Stir well to combine.<br><br>
          10. Add Salt and Sugar to taste. Adjust the seasoning as per your preference.<br><br>
          11. Cook the mixture on low heat for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. This allows the flavors to meld together.<br><br>
          12. Once the Chana Ghanta is ready and has a thick consistency, remove it from the heat.<br><br>
          13. Garnish with freshly grated Coconut and a teaspoon of Ghee (Clarified Butter).<br><br>
          14. Serve hot with steamed rice or roti. Enjoy your authentic Jharkhandi Chana Ghanta.<br><br>
