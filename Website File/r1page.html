        <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>
        <P>
          1. Start by gathering all the required ingredients.<br><br>
          2. Clean and prepare the fresh or preserved bamboo shoots as needed for the recipe.<br><br>
          3. In a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of mustard oil until it starts to smoke slightly.<br><br>
          4. Reduce the heat to low, add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds, and let them sizzle for a few seconds.<br><br>
          5. Add 2 finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.<br><br>
          6. Stir in 6-8 minced garlic cloves and grated ginger. Sauté for another couple of minutes until the raw smell 
          disappears.<br><br>
          7. Add 2-3 slit green chillies and sauté for a bit of heat.<br><br>
          8. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chilli powder (adjust to taste), and 1 teaspoon 
          of coriander powder. Mix well to coat the ingredients with the spices.<br><br>
          9. Now, add the prepared bamboo shoots to the pan. Stir and cook for a few minutes to infuse the flavors.<br><br>
          10. Season with salt to taste and pour in 1 cup of water to create a flavorful gravy.<br><br>
          11. Cover the pan and simmer the curry on low heat until the bamboo shoots are tender and the flavors meld 
          together. This may take some time, so be patient and check occasionally. You may need to add more water if 
          it gets too dry.<br><br>
          12. Once the bamboo shoots are tender and the curry has reached your desired consistency, remove it from the 
          heat.<br><br>
          13. Garnish the bamboo shoot curry with fresh coriander leaves.<br><br>
          14. Serve hot with steamed rice or your choice of bread.<br><br>
          15. Enjoy your delicious Jharkhandi Bamboo Shoot Curry.<br><br>
